Current workflow


1. Read in data and give it headers (it came without headers)

2. NA values == '?' so drop those

3. Splitting the data manually into X and y
    * the data already comes split train/test

4. Split columns and one hot encode columns that are categorical and recombine
    * give the one hot encoder the required categories
    * use a custom BaseEstimator and TransformerMixin so I can pipe?

5. Label encode the y column

6. Run algorithm
